        <h3> The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
        <p> The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful
          forces are
          unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins
          (Elijah
          Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the
          Ringbearer
          - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.</p>

        <h3> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
        <p> The members of the Fellowship have split into three groups. Frodo and Sam face many perils on their
          continuing
          quest to save Middle-earth by destroying the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin escape from
          the Orcs
          and must convince the Ents to join the battle against evil. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter a
          mysteriously
          transformed Gandalf and battle Saruman's army at Helm's Deep.</p>
